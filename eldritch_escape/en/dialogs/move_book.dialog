As soon as you pick it up, a chill runs down your spine. Something about holding the book feels... wrong. You quickly put it back.
You thought you were ready to move it, but it feels like the book is resisting you. Maybe it's best to leave it here for now.
The moment you lift the book, a strange sensation washes over you. It’s like the book doesn’t want to be moved. You carefully set it back down.
A faint whispering seems to emanate from the pages as you pick it up. Unsettled, you return the book to its place, feeling that it’s better left untouched.
