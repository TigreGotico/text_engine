With a final, desperate twist, the cassette player shatters. The tape inside bursts open, spilling its contents onto the floor, and the eerie hum finally fades.
You smash the cassette player with all your strength, and it crumbles under the force. The tape breaks, unraveling on the floor, as if releasing something that should never have been heard.
The cassette player cracks open with a loud snap, the tape spilling out like a twisted, tangled mess. The silence that follows feels unnaturally final.
You shatter the cassette player with one powerful blow. The tape inside bursts open, and the once-faint whispering stops, leaving only the sound of your own breath.
The cassette player crumbles under your hand, the tape spilling out, and you feel an overwhelming sense of finality. The voice that once echoed from it is now gone.
