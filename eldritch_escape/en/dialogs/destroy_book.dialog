With a snap, the bookâ€™s spine breaks, its pages falling apart as if they had never been meant to last. Knowledge lost to the winds.
You rip the book in half, its pages scattering in all directions. Its once valuable contents are now just pulp and debris.
The book crumbles under your hands, the once-precious text now rendered unreadable and destroyed.
With each tear, the book loses its meaning, its words now scattered and useless. The wisdom it once held is gone.
You tear the book apart, its pages falling to the ground in tatters. What knowledge it contained is now lost to the ages.
