The scent of old oil and mold, mingling with something foul, almost rotten beneath the surface.
It smells like something ancient, a blend of dust and decay, as if the painting itself is made of mold.
A pungent odor, like wet canvas and despair, seems to seep from the painting.
The air around the painting is thick with a sour, nauseating tang, as though it hides something beyond the frame.
