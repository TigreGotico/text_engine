The window won't budge. It feels more like stone than glass.
You press against the window, but it doesn't yield. Its surface is unnaturally cold and unyielding.
No matter how hard you try, the window remains fixed in placeâ€”like it's part of the wall itself.
The glass hums faintly, resisting your touch. There's something wrong about this window.
