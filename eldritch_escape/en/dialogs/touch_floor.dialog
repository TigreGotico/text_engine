The boards *give* slightly under your touch—almost as though they breathe.
You press down and feel something shift—liquid, or perhaps something *soft* and alive.
A faint warmth radiates from the boards. They pulse like flesh beneath your fingers.
The wood feels slick and damp, as though coated in a thin film of something foul.
The cold of the floor seeps into your skin, as though it’s sapping your warmth into the depths below.
It feels uneven, the texture more organic than solid—a floor that shouldn’t be.
A faint tremor runs through the ground, as if the very earth beneath you is alive and restless.
