A fleeting warmth pulses beneath the glass, as though something on the other side is mirroring you in return.
The surface vibrates faintly, and for an instant, you feel as though it might pull you in.
The pane vibrates faintly, and your reflection stares back at you with somethingâ€¦ off.
The cold lingers on your hand, a sensation of something vast and empty staring back.
A shock of heat flares against your fingertips. You pull away, but the sensation lingers.
The mirror is colder than ice, but something stirs beneath its surface.
You reach for the mirror, and for a moment, the reflection appears to reach back.
When you touch the surface of the mirror, it feels unnaturally cold, as though you're touching ice.
