You hear faint scratching noises from inside the walls.
A cold wind brushes against your neck, but there are no windows open.
You feel something watching you, though you see nothing.
The floor creaks as if someone is walking behind you.
The room seems to shift slightly, like a living thing adjusting its posture.
You hear whispers, but you cannot make out the words. The silence that follows is worse.
For a moment, the walls seem to close in, but then everything is normal again, if you can call this normal.
A cold breeze brushes past you, though there is no wind in this place.
The shadows in the corners seem darker now, as though something lurks within them.
