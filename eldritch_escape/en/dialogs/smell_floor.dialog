An acrid, metallic tang lingers in the air, as though the very earth itself is bleeding.
The floor reeks of dampness, of mold growing where the light dare not touch.
Something sour and old, the stench of long-dead things sealed beneath.
The floor smells of the voidâ€”cold, lifeless, and decaying, as if something slumbers beneath.
