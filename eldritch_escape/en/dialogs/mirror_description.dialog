The farthest wall reflects a distorted image in a mirror, your own face twisted into something unrecognizable.
In the distance, you see what appears to be a mirror, but it seems like the reflection is of a place you haven't seen.
A faint reflection in the farthest wall seems to show another version of the room, or something darker lurking within it.
A mirror on the distant wall shows only shadows, shifting unnaturally, as though something is trapped within it.
