The wall reeks of damp fungus, an overpowering stench of mold thriving in eternal darkness.
A sickly, fungal odor rises from the stone, like a tomb forgotten by light and air.
You inhale the scent of decay—earthy, thick, and alive, as though spores drift unseen in the air.
The smell of mildew clings to the wall, sharp and ancient, like a crypt that has begun to breathe.
Beneath the rot and mold, a strange sweetness lingers, unnervingly organic and cloying.
The fungal stench seems to grow stronger, as though the wall itself is breathing its corruption toward you.
You catch the faintest hint of something unnatural—like rot mixed with an otherworldly effervescence.
