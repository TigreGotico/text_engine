A faint scratching sound echoes from within the walls, growing louder the longer you listen.
It begins as a whisper—scraping, scuttling—then swells into a chorus of rats, swarming unseen.
You hear something gnawing, as though teeth are burrowing through stone just beyond reach.
The walls seem alive with movement, a ceaseless rustling that never comes to the surface.
For a moment, the scratching stops… replaced by a silence so heavy it feels deliberate.
You press your ear closer, and a distant chittering resolves into something… almost like speech.
The sound stirs a primal terror—a chaos of tiny claws and endless hunger beyond the stone.
