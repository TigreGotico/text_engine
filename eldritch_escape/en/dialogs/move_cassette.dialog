You set the cassette player down on the ground, but as your eyes flicker away for just a moment, it’s gone. You don’t recall picking it back up, yet it rests once more in your pocket.
A chill crawls up your spine as you wonder if the act of placing it down was merely an illusion. The cassette player’s presence has become a relentless weight, always there, even when you’re not aware of it.
You place the cassette player on the cold floor, and when you look back, it’s as if it never left your hand. A creeping dread fills you as the object defies your understanding. How did it return to you? And why can’t you remember?
The cassette player seems to mock you, as though it has a will of its own. You set it on the ground, yet before you even realize it, the object reappears in your pocket, as though it had never been out of your grasp.
You place the cassette player gently on the floor, only for it to somehow find its way back to you, its presence as unsettling as ever. You can’t help but wonder if you're trapped in a strange loop, forever bound to the object without escape.
