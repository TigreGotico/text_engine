The mirror is far too heavy to shift, its reflection mocking you with every futile attempt.
No matter how much you struggle, moving the mirror changes nothing; the path forward remains elusive.
The mirror can't be moved. It's as though it knows your desperation, and refuses to give you any advantage in your escape.
You feel a cold chill as you try to move it, the reflection staring back with an empty gaze that mirrors your own hopelessness.
