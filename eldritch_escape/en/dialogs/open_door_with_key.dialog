You try to use the key, but it simply does not fit. The door resists your efforts, as though mocking you.
The key turns in the lock, but the door doesn't budge. It's as if the key were made for nothing at all.
You jam the key into the lock with frustration. It fits, but nothing happens. The door remains closed.
You push the key into the door, but it does nothing. Itâ€™s a cruel trick, a dead end.
