The painting is far too large to move, its frame unyielding as if it has become one with the wall.
Even if you could somehow shift it, what purpose would it serve in your escape? The painting is not your way out.
You feel the weight of its eyes on you, an oppressive force that discourages any further attempt to move it.
Moving it is futile, as if the very action would only seal your fate further within these walls.
