With a single strike, the painting shatters into fragments, its colors fading into nothingness. What secrets it held are now lost forever.
The canvas tears under your force, its once vibrant image now a shattered relic of the past.
The painting crumbles under your hands, the scene now a blur of broken pieces and lost memories.
As you destroy the painting, the room feels emptier, its once vibrant energy drained. What was once an eternal image is now nothing.
With a final blow, the painting is destroyed, leaving only dust and an unsettling silence in its wake.
