The stone surface feels warm, sticky. You pull back to find faint red smears on your skin.
The symbols carved into the stone seem to writhe under your fingers.
The altar hums faintly. You feel your heartbeat slow, matching its rhythm.
The surface is warm and smooth, yet it pulses faintly beneath your palm, like the skin of some slumbering behemoth.
Your fingers trace ancient carvings that seem to move and shift at your touch.
A sharp, electric pain jolts up your arm, as though the stone altar rejects your presence.
The stone feels unnaturally warm in places, as though it remembers the blood spilled upon it.
The moment your hand rests on the altar, an overwhelming sense of dread floods your mind.
