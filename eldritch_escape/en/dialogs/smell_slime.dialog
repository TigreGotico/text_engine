A fetid, earthy stench, like decay left too long in the dark.
The smell of something ancient, a thick, oily substance that clings to the senses.
A rancid odor, like old, stagnant water mixed with the musk of forgotten places.
Itâ€™s as if the air itself is rotting, filled with something that should not exist.
