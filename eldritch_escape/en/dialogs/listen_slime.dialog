A faint, wet squelching sound echoes unnaturally, as though something is shifting and pulsing in the darkness.
The silence is broken by a rhythmic, viscous dripping—a sound that suggests something living, something breathing.
You hear a soft, grotesque slithering, like tendrils dragging across damp stone.
There’s a muted, bubbling gurgle, as though something gelatinous is trying to speak but has no mouth to form the words.
The sound is faint, yet unbearable—like a thousand tiny movements writhing just out of sight.
You strain to listen, and the noise grows clearer: a slow, deliberate oozing, as if something vast and shapeless is crawling closer.
