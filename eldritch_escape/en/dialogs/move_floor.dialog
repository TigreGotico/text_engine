You pry the floorboards loose with trembling hands and slip into the void below. What horrors await you now?
With great effort, you remove the floorboards and descend into the darkness below. The air is thick with the smell of decay, and you can feel something watching you from the shadows.
The floorboards creak and groan as you pull them aside, revealing the yawning chasm below. You step forward, your mind screaming at you to stop, but you descend anyway into the unknown.
Your hands are slick with sweat as you remove the floorboards and descend into the abyss. The very air seems to pulse with a malevolent energy, and you feel your sanity slipping further away.
The floorboards give way, and you step into the void below. A wave of dread fills you as the darkness swallows you whole. There's no turning back now.
