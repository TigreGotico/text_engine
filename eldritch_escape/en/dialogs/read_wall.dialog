The symbols twist and writhe, refusing to hold their shape for long.
You try to focus on the carvings, but they seem to bleed across the surface like black veins.
The writing defies understanding—jagged and curling shapes that suggest no human hand made them.
Your mind strains to comprehend the marks, but the more you stare, the more they unsettle you.
For a moment, the symbols seem to pulse, burning into your vision with a lightless energy.
They are words without language—older than thought, and filled with a silent, dreadful intent.
You look away quickly, the indecipherable script leaving a cold emptiness in your chest.
