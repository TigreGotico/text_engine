You drop the cassette player onto the ground. It lands with a faint thud, the strange hum still lingering in the air.
The cassette player falls from your hands, hitting the floor with a soft clink. It almost feels like it doesn't want to leave you.
You let the cassette player slip from your grip. It lands gently on the floor, almost as if it was waiting for you to let go.
The cassette player drops from your hand, but the odd sense of connection doesnâ€™t fade.
You release the cassette player, and it falls to the floor with a dull sound, still radiating an eerie presence.
