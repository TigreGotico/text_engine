All that remains of the painting are fragments of canvas and fading memories, lost to time and your actions.
The area where the painting hung is now bare, the colors and imagery gone, leaving only emptiness.
The remnants of the painting litter the floor, a reminder of the destruction you caused. The room feels less alive without it.
The space where the painting once was is now hollow. Its image is lost, and all that remains is the aftermath of your decision.
