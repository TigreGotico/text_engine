It is small, but its weight defies understanding—no human could ever move it.
The altar seems to resist, as though it is rooted in something far older, far deeper than mere stone.
You attempt to shift it, but its immensity is not measured in size, but in a presence that seems to warp time itself.
Though seemingly small, it feels as though it anchors the very room, a fixture that no mortal force could displace.
You push with all your might, but the altar holds firm, as if it were more a part of the room than an object within it.
There is a strange paradox to its size—small, yet insurmountable, as though it was never meant to be moved.
The altar resists your touch, not through physical weight alone, but through an overwhelming force that seems beyond human comprehension.
Even if you could move it, something about it feels... wrong, as if shifting it might alter the very fabric of the room.
It is an object of both immensity and fragility—small, yet the weight of centuries seems to press upon it.
No hands, no matter how strong, could ever hope to disturb it. It seems almost as if it is bound to the very essence of this place.
