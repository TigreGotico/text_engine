A faint, unnerving shimmer emanates from a window, its glass barely containing the void beyond.
The window appears almost liquid, rippling with an unnatural energy. You feel something watching you from beyond.
Darkness stretches beyond the window, as if the glass holds back a universe of unspeakable horrors.
The window is a mirror to nothingness, the glass cold and untouched, yet the air around it buzzes with static electricity.
