You hesitate. Your hands tremble as you look at the floorboards. Something deep inside warns you not to disturb what lies beneath. It feels like you are not ready for what awaits you down there.
The air feels heavier the closer you get to the floorboards. A voice whispers from the back of your mind, urging you to turn away. You can't shake the feeling that disturbing the floor might break you, or worse.
A wave of unease washes over you. The floorboards seem to mock you, daring you to pry them loose. But your mind protests, pulling you back from the brink. You're not sure if you're ready to face what lies below.
As you reach for the floorboards, a deep dread rises from within you. The very idea of moving them fills you with terror, and your body refuses to obey. Perhaps you're not prepared for what the void holds.
You stand there, staring at the floorboards, unsure of what youâ€™ll find beneath. Your sanity clings to you like a fragile thread, and you feel like tearing it apart by disturbing the floor might not be wise.
