You feel a cold chill in the air, and the dim light flickers above you.
The room is silent, but something feels... off. There's a strange sense of dread in the air.
You can't quite remember how you got here. A door stands before you, and the shadows seem to stretch unnaturally.
You notice strange symbols etched into the wall, and the faint smell of something rotten lingers in the corner.
Your mind feels clouded, as if a fog is settling over your thoughts.
