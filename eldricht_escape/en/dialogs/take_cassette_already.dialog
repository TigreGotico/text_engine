You already possess the cassette player. Its presence is as inevitable as the dark, an anchor to something you cannot escape.
The cassette player rests in your hands, though it feels less like a possession and more like a curse you cannot shake.
It seems you have already taken hold of the cassette player, though it now feels as though it has always been with you, a dark companion.
The cassette player is already in your grasp, but you cannot rid yourself of the strange compulsion to hold it, as if it were never meant to leave.
