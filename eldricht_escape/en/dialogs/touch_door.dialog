The wood feels damp, unnaturally cold. Your hand lingers longer than you meant.
Your fingers stick slightly to the surface, as though the door *wants* to keep you.
The surface vibrates faintly, a heartbeat pounding within the wood itself.
The wood feels damp and swollen, as though it’s been breathing in something foul.
Your hand tingles unpleasantly, like the door resents being touched.
It is unyielding, yet there’s a sensation of something pulsing beneath its surface.
The grain of the wood seems to shift under your palm, as though alive with unseen patterns.
The door feels oddly warm, as if something waits on the other side, exhaling against it.
