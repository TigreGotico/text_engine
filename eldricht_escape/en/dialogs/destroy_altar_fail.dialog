The altar is an ancient relic, etched with symbols of power and protection. Destroying it would release dark forces you cannot control.
The altarâ€™s essence is bound to the land itself. Disrupting it could unravel the very fabric of reality.
You dare not destroy this sacred place. To do so would summon powers far beyond your comprehension.
Breaking the altar would only result in chaos. The spiritual balance here is far too delicate.
