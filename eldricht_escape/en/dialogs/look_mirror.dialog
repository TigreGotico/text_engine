Your reflection smiles, but you did not smile. Your sanity shivers.
The mirror shows a dark figure standing behind you, but when you turn, no one is there.
The mirror's surface ripples like water. You catch a glimpse of something behind you, but when you turn, nothing is there.
The mirror's reflection twists into a monstrous visageâ€”your face, but horribly distorted and wrong. You stumble back, your mind reeling, as your sanity erodes.
