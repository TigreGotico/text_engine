You try to dismiss it, but deep down, you can feel the dread creeping in. It’s not just a message; it's a pattern... a pattern you've heard before.
At first, you think it's just your mind playing tricks on you, but then the voice becomes undeniable. It's yours. The words... the panic... you recognize the tremor in your own voice, and it shakes you to the core. How many times has this happened?
The voice. It’s unmistakable now. It’s yours. You realize, as the static recedes and the recording plays on, that you’ve heard these words before. It’s not the first time you’ve been here. It's not the first time this... *this* has happened.
You can no longer deny it—the voice from the tape is yours. You hear the tremor in your own words, the crackling static not as foreign as it once seemed. The eerie realization sinks in: you're trapped in a cycle. And you can't remember... how many times you've been here before.
As the distorted voice echoes, you can feel your sanity slipping further. But it’s undeniable now. The voice in the recording, the one pleading, the one panicked, it *is* you. How many loops have you endured? How many times have you forgotten and started over?
