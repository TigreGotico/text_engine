Iridescent slime coats the walls, as though it is waiting for something to break its stillness.
The slime on the wall writhes slowly, as if it's aware of your presence, its translucent form reflecting your every move.
You can't help but notice the slime oozing from the walls, it seems to pulse, alive in its own way, rippling as though it senses your thoughts.
Thick, viscous slime clings to the walls, its sheen flickering like a dying star, tempting you to touch it.
