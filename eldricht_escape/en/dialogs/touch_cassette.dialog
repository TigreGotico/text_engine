The cassette player feels cold to the touch, its surface covered in dust. It seems like it hasn’t been used in years.
You touch the cassette player, but your hand lingers on it for a moment too long, as if it’s absorbing something from you.
It’s an old, weathered cassette player. You touch it carefully, wary of disturbing something that might not want to be disturbed.
Your fingers brush against the buttons, feeling the rough edges where time has worn them down.
