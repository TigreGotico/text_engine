The mirror lies in pieces on the floor, its reflective surface shattered beyond repair. The truth it held is lost.
The remnants of the mirror reflect nothing but fragments of broken glass. What it once revealed is now impossible to see.
What once reflected your image is now a pile of jagged glass shards. The mirror’s truth is no longer accessible.
The mirror’s shattered fragments lie across the floor, no longer offering insight into the world beyond.
The pieces of the mirror are scattered about, each shard reflecting only chaos. There is no longer a connection to the world it once showed.
