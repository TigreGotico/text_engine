The scent of aged parchment, musty with the weight of forgotten knowledge.
A peculiar, almost sweet odorâ€”like a rotting fruit, trapped in the pages of a cursed tome.
It smells of dust and mildew, but with an undertone of something ancient, stirring.
The air around the book seems to warp, carrying the faintest trace of something... otherworldly.
