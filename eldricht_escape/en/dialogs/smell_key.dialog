The key smells faintly of rust, but there’s something more—a cold, unnameable stench, like the decay of forgotten knowledge.
It smells of old metal, but underneath is the faintest trace of salt and the tang of something long since buried beneath the earth.
The key carries the scent of ancient, forgotten places, of damp crypts and the putrid odor of things that have waited far too long.
A faint, oily smell lingers on the key, as though it was once held by hands long decayed, with memories that should never have been unearthed.
