The smell of incense, thick and cloying, hangs heavy in the air, but underneath, something far darker lingers—a scent of ancient decay.
The altar reeks of burnt offerings, old blood, and something far older, like the remnants of forgotten rituals.
There’s a putrid, metallic tang, like rusting iron, mixed with a foul, earthy stench as if the very stone beneath has absorbed unspeakable horrors.
A faint odor of mildew and rotting flesh clings to the altar, as though it has been used for rituals that should have never been performed.
