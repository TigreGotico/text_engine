The mirror shatters with a deafening crack, its glass splintering into a thousand shards. The truth it reflected is now scattered across the floor.
You strike the mirror, and it cracks into pieces, each shard reflecting distorted versions of yourself as it falls.
With a final push, the mirror shatters, and the world it showed you is no longer visible. Only broken glass remains.
The glass fractures under your touch, the once-perfect reflection of reality now splintered and lost.
The mirror cracks open, its pieces falling to the floor in a cascade of glass. The reflection it held is no more.
