You open the tome, and the words wriggle like worms across the pages. Eldritch chants seep into your brain, filling it with horrors you cannot comprehend.
As you flip the pages, the text twists and writhes, its language alien and terrifying. A cold sensation creeps through your mind as whispers start to fill the air.
The bookâ€™s pages flutter open on their own, and the words seem to slither across the paper. The air around you grows colder, and you can hear distant whispers.
You open the book and are greeted by impossible words that twist as if alive. The air grows thick, and your mind begins to reel with impossible thoughts.
