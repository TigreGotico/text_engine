You strain to listen, but only an oppressive silence presses against your ears.
There is nothing to hear hereâ€”no life, no sound, just an endless, suffocating quiet.
The silence hangs heavy, as though the air itself resents disturbance.
You hear nothing, but somehow the absence of sound feels alive, as though waiting.
The void of sound surrounds you, a stillness that gnaws at your senses.
Your ears find nothing but silence, yet a creeping unease suggests you are not alone.
The room seems to absorb all sound, leaving only your pulse as a rhythm against the void.
A heavy hush smothers the air, like the quiet that precedes a calamity untold.
You hear nothing... and yet something hears you.
