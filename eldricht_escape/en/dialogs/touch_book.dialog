The cover feels strangely warm, as though the book has been handled recently—or is alive.
Its leather surface is rough and cracked, pulsing faintly under your touch.
You feel something wriggle beneath the binding, as if the book is trying to escape your grasp.
Your fingers tingle as though they’ve brushed against something ancient and unspeakable.
The texture is indescribable, like dried skin stretched taut over secrets best left forgotten.
