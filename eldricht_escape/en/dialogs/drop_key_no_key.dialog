The key feels heavy in your memories, as though its presence is still lingering with you.
You remember holding the key in your hands, the weight of it growing heavier with each passing second.
Your hands are empty. The key is gone, lost to you, and the altar stands unmoving, as though mocking your confusion.
You feel around, but the key is nowhere to be found. The altar watches you with a stillness that deepens your unease.
