As you pick up the key, it feels unnaturally cold. Whispers dance at the edge of your hearing.
The key's surface sends a jolt of chill through your fingers. You hear faint whispers, though you see no one.
You grasp the key reluctantly. It's as cold as death, and your head swims with ghostly murmurs.
The moment you touch the key, a fleeting shadow passes before your eyes. The air feels heavier now.
