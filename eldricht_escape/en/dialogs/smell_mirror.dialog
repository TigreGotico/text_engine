A strange, metallic scentâ€”like rust mixed with the faintest trace of decay.
The mirror smells of stagnant air, as though it reflects a place that should not be.
It carries a faint odor of cold, like iron left too long in the dark, untouched by time.
A bitter, almost medicinal smell, as though it has been used to trap the very essence of something lost.
