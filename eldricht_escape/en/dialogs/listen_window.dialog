A pulsing vibration makes your teeth ache. You feel it more than hear it.
The silence presses like a weight, growing louder the harder you listen.
A faint *thud* against the glass repeats in rhythm. You see nothing.
A hollow wail rises and falls, though there is no wind outside.
The glass vibrates beneath your fingers. Something presses back.
An eerie silence, as if the world itself holds its breath.
No wind, no flutter of wingsâ€”only a profound emptiness pressing against the glass.
Not a creature stirs; the stillness gnaws at the edges of your sanity.
The silence is unnatural, as though the very air is watching, waiting.
