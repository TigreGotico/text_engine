The sound comes again, soft as moth wings—something writhes. Not rats. No rat moves like that.
The boards beneath you groan, but not in protest. It is a sigh, almost... contentment.
You hear faint murmurs—a wet, bubbling whisper echoing up from the unseen depths.
The scuttling circles—around and *underneath* you. It knows you're listening.
Something brushes the underside of the boards—a limb? A claw? It drags, then stops.
A faint whisper of water, as if it were flowing from some unknowable source.
Scurrying... something small, something too many for comfort, moving beneath the floor.
A shifting, crawling sound that does not belong.
