The slime clings to everything it touches, a living entity of its own. Trying to destroy it might just make it spread further.
It's not something you can destroy. The more you try, the more it multiplies, like a disease.
Slime is alive. Breaking it apart only causes it to regenerate into something worse.
Destroying the slime would only fuel its growth. You must find another way to deal with it.
Itâ€™s better to avoid the slime. Destroying it could summon an even larger, more dangerous mass.
