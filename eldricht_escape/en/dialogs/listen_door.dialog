A shuffling of feet—many feet. They stop, synchronized, as your ear touches the wood.
Claws scrape patterns into the door. The symbols *burn* in your mind.
A slow, measured rasp—breathing, too deliberate, too heavy, too wrong.
Wet skin slaps against stone in the distance—crawling, moving.
A whisper, unmistakably your name, hissed from beyond the door.
Is that a snore? No... a rumbling growl from deep within the earth itself.
Words, but not in any tongue you recognize, their meaning a corruption of thought.
Gargling, wet sounds, like something struggling to speak from beyond the veil.
A presence... something ancient, thrumming just beyond the threshold, stirring.
