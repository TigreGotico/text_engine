The book is in ruins, its pages torn and scattered. Whatever wisdom it held is now lost and beyond your reach.
What was once a source of knowledge is now a pile of shredded paper and broken binding, no longer worth your attention.
The book is now a mere collection of torn pages and broken covers, the knowledge once held within it completely lost.
The pages of the book lie in disarray, destroyed beyond recognition. Its teachings are gone, leaving only emptiness behind.
The remnants of the book are scattered across the floor, its once-valuable knowledge destroyed and forgotten.
