"The slime... that was once contained around the painting... it... it’s spreading. It covers almost a third of the room now... or more... I can't tell. It feels... like it’s... growing... consuming."
"Maybe... maybe there’s an exit, but... I’m sure it’s not the door or the window. I ruled them both out. There's a... a draft? A breeze somewhere, I think... but where’s it coming from?"
"I can hear it, I think... ticking. A clock, maybe? It’s distant, echoing from beneath... but it stopped hours ago. Nothing moves here, nothing but *time* that feels wrong."
"I swear, I hear rats... When I press my ear to the floor, they stop. The sound vanishes. It's like they *know*... that they're being listened to. But... there's more. The silence is... suffocating."
"The floor... it’s strange. I thought I felt a shift beneath me, a hollow sound... as if something’s hidden there. Maybe under the boards? I’m not sure, but... I think there’s something *alive* in there. I can’t explain it. Maybe a way out?"
"That thing... that thing in the wall... it’s not a mirror. I can see it now... what it shows you isn't real. The reflection... it’s... it’s something else. It’s... *wrong*."
"I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before... but I heard a scraping sound, like wood being moved. It's under the floor. I... I think the boards can be lifted. If I can get to it, maybe... maybe there’s a tunnel beneath, a way out of this nightmare."
"The more I listen to the silence, the more I hear it... A soft thud, like something large, something heavy, moving in the dark. I tried to lift the boards, but it feels like they're... stuck. Like they don’t want to be moved, like they're resisting me."
"I don’t know what it is, but the ground shifts beneath me. I swear, I felt a cold breath come from below... Maybe it’s a tunnel, maybe not. But... I feel like there’s something *watching* me from under the floor, like I’m not supposed to disturb it."
"The scraping... it’s real, I’m not imagining it. I think I’ve found the edge of a board that can be moved. But when I put my hand there, the air... it changed. Like something opened below, something that’s been waiting for me to find it. I... I think I’ve found the way out, but I’m not sure if I should go. What if I open it... and something comes back with me?"
