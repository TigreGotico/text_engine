There is a book. You sense an eerie presence near it. The air thickens around it, as if something awaits your approach.
An old, weathered book rests before you, its pages flickering, as though trying to escape their bindings.
The book radiates an aura of ancient knowledge, but something feels offâ€”like it knows you're here and is waiting.
A dusty tome lies open, the words shifting and changing as you approach, beckoning you to read them.
