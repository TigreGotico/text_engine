The door remains shut. Its surface pulses as though alive. You don't have what you need to open it.
You push against the door, but it holds firm. The key... you need the key.
The door seems to breathe, mocking your efforts. You're missing something crucial.
The door refuses to open. It shudders as though taunting you for your lack of preparation.
