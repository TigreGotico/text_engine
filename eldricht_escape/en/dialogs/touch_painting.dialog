The canvas feels soft, too soft. Like fungal flesh stretched over a frame.
Your fingers sink slightly, and you swear the painting flinches at your touch.
The paint feels wet, though the image does not smearâ€”it holds its form, as if alive.
The surface is cold and unyielding, yet it seems to pulse faintly, as though it has a heartbeat.
